Forensics 200: 0100110101000001010100100100100101001111 (Mario)

Who doesn't love an excuse to go back and play some classic games!
Although it should have been pretty apparent from the start that this wasn't the original ROM (mario was named RC3)

From the hint about trying to get through to the first castle, you either played the game and got stuck on the wall or opened up a ROM editor to cheat your way there!
You should have noticed some editing and moving of piecies of the level, specifically some fire spinners nicely lined up in a hallway.

The hinted at fact that the flag was short + the binary in the title should have hinted you to view this as a 32 bit string (fire spinners and the final wall as 1's, empty spaces as 0's to give you the final text and flag:

RC3{RTAI}
